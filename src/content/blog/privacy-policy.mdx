## <a name="Headings"></a>Introduction

VCodes ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to respecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when you use our Focus20 app ("the App"). This Policy is compliant with Apple's privacy policy and we encourage you to read it carefully to understand our practices.


## Information We Collect:

In order to provide and improve our services, we collect the following types of data:

* Apple ID: Your Apple ID is used to authenticate and authorize your use of the App.
* User Name: We collect your user name to personalize your experience.
* Email Address: We use your email address for sign-in purposes and to send you app notifications.

Please note that all of this data is stored securely in **Apple's CoreData** (in your own apple devices) and **iCloud** and is accessible only by you.

### Use of Your Information:
The personal data we collect is used solely for the purpose of providing and maintaining the App. **We do not use your data for marketing campaigns, nor do we share it with any third parties.**

### Storage and Security:
We take data security seriously. All of your personal data is securely stored using Apple's CoreData and iCloud, and is operated according to Apple's privacy and security standards. Only you have access to your data. We do not store your data elsewhere or share it with external parties.

### Ads-Free:
Our App does not display any third-party advertisements, so you don't need to worry about ad-related data collection or tracking within the App.

## Children's Privacy
We are committed to protecting the privacy of children who use our App. Focus20 does not collect or store any user data, making it a safe choice for children. We encourage parents and guardians to monitor their child's online activity and to help enforce this policy.

In the case where users are signing in with Apple ID, we recommend using the "Hide My Email" feature offered by Apple, which creates a unique, random email address so your personal email can stay private. This feature allows children to use the App without disclosing their real email address, thereby enhancing their personal data safety.

We adhere strictly to laws and regulations regarding children's privacy, such as the **Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)** in the United States and relevant laws in other jurisdictions. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 or the relevant minimum age under applicable local legal requirements without obtaining parental consent.

If parents or guardians become aware that their child has provided us with personal information without their consent, they should contact us at [your contact email address]. If we become aware that a child under the age of 13 (or under the relevant age limit) has provided us with personal information without parental consent, we take steps to remove such information and terminate the child's account.


## Your Rights:
You have the right to access and modify your personal data at any time through your iCloud account. You also have the right to opt-out of receiving app notifications by changing your settings within the App.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy:
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and if significant changes are made, we will provide a more prominent notice within the App.

## Contact Us:
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, or if you would like to exercise your data protection rights, please feel free to contact us [at our contact page](/contact).

By using our App, you consent to our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use our App. Your continued use of the App following the posting of changes to this policy will be deemed as your acceptance of those changes.
